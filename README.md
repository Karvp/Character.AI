# Character.AI
An unofficial high level API for character.ai for Python

# Introduction
The original idea was from [kramcat's CharacterAI](https://github.com/kramcat/characterai). This library aims on ease of use rather than a more functional library.

> [!NOTE]
> This library is developing. Every contribution is greatly appreciated
